# Task 01 - Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

This task is part of a structured AI/ML internship designed to reinforce fundamentals through hands-on practice.

## Objective
Perform exploratory analysis and preprocessing (null handling, encoding, scaling, outlier removal) on the Titanic dataset to prepare it for machine learning.

## Highlights
- Practical preprocessing with real-world dataset
- Feature encoding (Label & One-Hot)
- Outlier removal using IQR method
- Scaling via StandardScaler
- Code written modularly for reuse

## Dataset
[Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset)

## Tools Used
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
